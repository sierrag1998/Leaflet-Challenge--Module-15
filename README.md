# Leaflet-Challenge--Module-15

About this assignment:
Module 15 Leaflet challenge is a earthquake visualization with all earthquakes in the past 7 days as reported by The United States Geological Survey. This interactive map includes data on the location, time, magnitude, and depth. The depth is displayed by the different color of the marker (legend included) and the magnitude is displayed by the different sizes of each marker (the bigger the marker, the bigger the magntitude). Click on each marker to view a popup providing more information about each earthquake. 

About this repository: 
This repository includes a HTML titled index.html, a static folder which includes a JS file titled "logic.js" which holds the code for the interactive map. The static folder alo includes a CSS file title "style.css" which holds the code for formatting. 

The repository also includes a PNG titled "preview" which is a screenshot of my map. It also includes a PDF of the rubric in which I tailored my assignment to. 


Thanks for viewing,
